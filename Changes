Revision history for File::Rotate::Simple

{{$NEXT}}
  [Documentation]
  - Added more example code

  [Enhancements]
  - The file selection regexp is an attribute, and the file renaming
    code is in a separate method that allows the behaviour to be
    modified in a subclass.

    The processing order of files is sorted by dependency order
    (e.g. "foo.2" is renamed to "foo.3" before "foo.1" is renamed to
    "foo.2"), so as to allow more kinds of file rotation schemes.

  [Incompatable Changes]
  - The default file selection regexp is case-insensitive, although
    for most use cases this should have no effect.
